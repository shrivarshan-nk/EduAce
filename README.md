**EduAce Student Exam Preparation Assistant**
**Problem Statement**
Students often face challenges in preparing for exams due to the overwhelming amount of information and resources scattered across various textbooks, online resources, and question banks. This fragmentation of information makes it difficult to get detailed explanations, relevant practice questions, and mock exams in a unified platform. Furthermore, personalized assistance and interactive methods like quizzes or audio explanations are often missing in traditional study approaches.

The problem becomes even more pronounced for students preparing for specific curricula (e.g., CBSE, ISCE) as it requires targeted study materials, which aren't always available in one place. Additionally, students often lack immediate access to question banks, mock exams, and proctored environments that simulate real exam conditions.

**Solution**
The GenAI-Powered Student Exam Preparation Assistant addresses these issues by leveraging the power of Googleâ€™s Generative AI (Gemini) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to provide a comprehensive study tool. This tool solves the problem in the following ways:

1. Personalized Topic Explanations
Students can input any topic and select a specific curriculum (e.g., CBSE, ISCE).
The AI generates a detailed explanation of the topic tailored to the chosen curriculum.
Students no longer need to sift through multiple textbooks or online resources to understand a topic.
2. Interactive Quizzes
After generating an explanation for a topic, students can also generate quiz questions.
These quizzes consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that are directly related to the explained content, allowing for immediate practice.
3. Audio Explanations
The app also converts generated text explanations into audio files, which are stored and accessible for future playback.
This feature supports auditory learners or students who prefer listening to explanations on the go.
4. Mock Question Papers
The tool allows students to generate mock question papers for specific subjects.
These question papers simulate real exam conditions, giving students the opportunity to test their knowledge in a structured format.
5. AI Proctored Test Environment
Students can take AI proctored tests, where the tool generates a question paper and allows them to upload their responses.
This helps simulate real exam conditions and provides a space to practice exams with a more formal feel.
6. Centralized Storage of Audio & Question Papers
The app provides dedicated sections in the sidebar for accessing stored audio explanations and mock question papers.
This creates a single, unified platform where students can generate, store, and access personalized study materials in one place.
How It Works
Topic Explanation:

Users can enter a topic and choose a curriculum. The Generative AI then crafts a detailed, curriculum-specific explanation for that topic.
Quiz Generation:

Based on the explanation, users can generate quizzes that contain MCQs, allowing them to practice their understanding immediately.
Audio Generation:

The text explanations can be converted into audio using the TTS feature, allowing users to listen to the explanation.
Mock Question Papers:

Students can generate mock question papers for specific subjects, which are stored in a dedicated section in the sidebar.
AI Proctored Test:

The app generates a test environment where students can download the question paper and upload their answers as a file.
